</div>

This project is a Laravel implementation of the original [Shadcn Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin), combining the power of Laravel's backend with React's frontend capabilities through Inertia.js. The UI components and design are adapted from the original project while being integrated into a full-stack Laravel application.

## About This Implementation

This is a complete Laravel application featuring:

- **Backend**: Laravel 12 with Inertia.js server-side adapter
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Laravel Wayfinder for type-safe routing
- **SSR Support**: Server-side rendering capabilities with Inertia.js
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Laravel plugin integration

## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Responsive
- Accessible
- With built-in Sidebar component
- Global search command
- 10+ pages
- Extra custom components
- RTL support

<details>
<summary>Customized Components (click to expand)</summary>

This project uses Shadcn UI components, but some have been slightly modified for better RTL (Right-to-Left) support and other improvements. These customized components differ from the original Shadcn UI versions.

If you want to update components using the Shadcn CLI (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`), it's generally safe for non-customized components. For the listed customized ones, you may need to manually merge changes to preserve the project's modifications and avoid overwriting RTL support or other updates.

> If you don't require RTL support, you can safely update the 'RTL Updated Components' via the Shadcn CLI, as these changes are primarily for RTL compatibility. The 'Modified Components' may have other customizations to consider.

### Modified Components

- scroll-area
- sonner
- separator

### RTL Updated Components

- alert-dialog
- calendar
- command
- dialog
- dropdown-menu
- select
- table
- sheet
- sidebar
- switch

**Notes:**

- **Modified Components**: These have general updates, potentially including RTL adjustments.
- **RTL Updated Components**: These have specific changes for RTL language support (e.g., layout, positioning).
- For implementation details, check the source files in `resources/js/components/ui/`.
- All other Shadcn UI components in the project are standard and can be safely updated via the CLI.
